# VSCode Development Sandbox Image

This Docker image is a basic image for building VSCode [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and developing Rust solutions inside a Docker container (i.e. a `sandbox`).

It provides some basic features any decent sandbox requires, such as, for instance, a non-root user, a nice console prompt with user and git branch and state, and so on.
