# Rust Compiler and Tools

This Docker image is used for compiling Rust projects inside a Docker container. It can be used as well, for building VSCode [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and develop inside a Docker container (i.e. inside a `sandbox`).

NOTE:
This documentation is a work in progress. It will be upgraded soon.
