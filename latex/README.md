# LaTeX Docker Image

This Docker image is used for compiling LaTeX documents inside a Docker container. It can be used as well, for building VSCode [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) and editing LaTeX documents inside a Docker container (also called `sandbox`).

NOTE:
This documentation is a work in progress. It will be upgraded soon.
